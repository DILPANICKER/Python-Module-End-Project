# An Overview of the ABC Company Employee Data Analysis Project
## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze ABC Company's employee dataset (458 rows × 9 columns) to gain insights into team distributions, salary structures, age demographics, and position-wise trends. The analysis involved data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and deriving actionable insights for strategic decision-making.  
## 2. Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset required cleaning and standardization to ensure consistency:  
Key Preprocessing Steps:  
### Height Column Correction:
  - Replaced inconsistent height entries with random values between **150 and 180 cm** for uniformity.  
### Missing Value Handling:
  - Filled missing Salaryvalues with the median salary to avoid bias.  
### Data Type Conversion:
  - Ensured the Height column was in numeric format for analysis.  

### Why Preprocessing Was Necessary?:
- Ensured data integrity before statistical analysis.  
- Eliminated inconsistencies that could skew results.  
- Prepared the dataset for accurate visualizations.  

## 3. Analysis Tasks & Findings
### 1. Employee Distribution by Team
- Objective:Determine how employees are distributed across teams and their percentage contributions.  
- Findings:  
  - Teams like Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets had slightly higher representation.  
  - Most teams had 15-20 employees, with no single team dominating.  
- Visualization: Bar chart showing employee count per team.  

### 2. Employee Segregation by Position  
- Objective: Identify the most common job positions.  
- Findings:  
  - Shooting Guards (SG) and Point Guards (PG) were the most frequent positions.  
  - Centers (C) and Power Forwards (PF) followed closely.  
- Visualization: Bar chart displaying position-wise distribution.  

 ### 3. Predominant Age Group
- Objective:Identify the most common age range among employees.  
- Findings:  
  - The 26-30 age group was the largest, indicating peak performance years.  
  - Few employees were above 35, likely due to the physical demands of the sport.  
- Visualization:Bar chart categorizing employees into age groups.  

### 4. Highest Salary Expenditure (Team & Position) 
- Objective: Determine which team and position incur the highest salary costs.  
- Findings:  
  - Los Angeles Clippers had the highest salary expenditure.  
  - Point Guards (PG)were the highest-paid position overall.  
- Visualization: Two bar charts comparing team-wise and position-wise salary totals.  

### 5. Correlation Between Age & Salary  
- Objective: Examine if age influences salary.  
- Findings:  
  - Moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.4-0.5) between age and salary.  
  - Peak earnings occurred between 27-32 years.  
- Visualization: Scatter plot showing age vs. salary distribution.  


## 4. Graphical Representations  
To effectively communicate insights, the following visualizations were created:  
1. Team Distribution → Bar Chart  
2. Position Segregation →  Chart 
3. Age Group Analysis → BarChart 
4. Salary Expenditure by Team & Position→ Bar Charts  
5. Age vs. Salary Correlation → Scatter Plot  
Each visualization was designed to be clear, labeled, and easy to interpret, ensuring stakeholders could quickly grasp key trends.  

## 5. Key Insights & Business Implications 
A. Workforce Composition
- The company maintains a balanced distribution across teams, avoiding over-reliance on any single group.  
-SG and PG positions dominate, suggesting a strategic focus on backcourt players.  

B. Salary & Experience Trends  
- Experienced players (26-30) earn more, but young talents also command high salaries, indicating performance-based pay.  
-PGs are the highest-paid, emphasizing their critical role in team success.  

C. Age & Career Longevity
- Few employees remain past 35, highlighting the physically demanding nature of the industry.  
- Succession planning is crucial to maintain a pipeline of young talent.  

## 6. Recommendations for ABC Company  
Based on the analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended:  
### 1. Review Compensation Models
   - Ensure younger high-performers are rewarded to prevent turnover.  
   - Consider performance-based incentives beyond age.  

### 2. Optimize Team Composition  
   - Maintain a mix of veteran leadership and young talent for balance.  
   - Invest in PG development programs given their high salary impact.  

### 3. Succession Planning
   - Focus on scouting and training younger players to replace aging employees.  

### 4. Salary Cap Management  
   - Monitor high-spending teams(e.g., LA Clippers) to ensure financial sustainability.
     
## 7. Conclusion 
This project successfully analyzed ABC Company’s employee data, revealing critical trends in team distribution, salary structures, age demographics, and position-wise expenditures. The insights derived can guide HR strategies, financial planning, and talent management to optimize workforce efficiency and competitiveness.
